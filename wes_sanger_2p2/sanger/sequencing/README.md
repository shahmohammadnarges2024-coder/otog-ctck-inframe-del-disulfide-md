# Sanger sequencing traces (OTOG exon 55)

This folder contains raw Sanger chromatogram files (.ab1) for validation and segregation analysis of the OTOG exon 55 deletion (NM_001292063.2, GRCh38):

- 66940 Proband-OTOG-EX55-F.ab1  → proband, forward read
- 66941 Affected-OTOG-E55F.ab1   → affected sibling, forward read
- 66942 Affected-OTOG-E55F.ab1   → affected sibling 2, forward read
- 66943 Mother-OTOG-E55-F.ab1    → mother, heterozygous carrier
- 66944 Father-OTOG-E55-F.ab1    → father, heterozygous carrier

These traces confirm segregation of the 12-bp in-frame deletion consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.

*Note:* Representative electropherogram images are provided in Supplementary Fig. S2.
